Tutorial on using bison from the manual.

See [here](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/bison/bison_5.html#SEC16).

I wrote this by hand but I basically followed the example in the manual.

I higly recommend going through it if you want to learn how to use 
tools like bison it's actually really quite well written.
